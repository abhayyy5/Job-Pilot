# Job-Pilot
Job Pilot is a simple and responsive job board platform created as my first B.Tech project. It helps users explore job listings easily with a clean UI and company logos. This project represents my learning journey in web development, and I will continue improving it with more features.
# 🧭 Job Pilot — Job Board Platform

Job Pilot is a clean and responsive job board platform developed as part of my B.Tech first-year learning journey in web development. The goal of this project is to help job seekers explore opportunities easily with simple navigation and visually appealing company branding.

This project helped me understand real-world concepts including UI design, file structure, responsive layouts, and asset management. I re-branded and modified the original design with my own theme, structure, and company assets to improve the user experience.
